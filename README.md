ðŸš€ Project Plan: Keycloak on OpenShift via GitOps (with Vault & Vault Secrets Operator)
This project plan details the steps to deploy, configure, and manage Keycloak as the OIDC identity provider for your OpenShift clusters (development and production) using a GitOps methodology powered by ArgoCD and Kustomize. OpenShift Data Foundation will be used for persistent database storage, and HashiCorp Vault with the Vault Secrets Operator (VSO) will manage secrets.

Project Goal: To establish a fully automated, version-controlled, and centrally managed Keycloak deployment that provides SSO for OpenShift and integrated services like ArgoCD, with distinct configurations for development and production environments, leveraging HashiCorp Vault for secure secret management via the Vault Secrets Operator.

Core Technologies:

OpenShift Container Platform: Your on-premise Kubernetes distribution.

Keycloak: The identity and access management solution.

PostgreSQL: The database for Keycloak.

OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF): For persistent storage.

ArgoCD: The GitOps continuous delivery tool.

Kustomize: For managing environment-specific configurations.

Git: The version control system for storing all configurations.

HashiCorp Vault: The external secrets management system.

Vault Secrets Operator (VSO): For synchronizing secrets from Vault to Kubernetes.

Important Prerequisite Note on HashiCorp Vault Installation:
This project plan assumes that a functional HashiCorp Vault instance (or cluster) is already deployed and accessible by your OpenShift clusters. The installation, configuration, and ongoing management of the Vault server itself are considered separate, significant undertakings and are outside the scope of this specific Keycloak deployment plan. This plan will cover the integration with an existing Vault instance, including configuring necessary auth methods, policies, and secret paths within Vault for this Keycloak deployment. If Vault is not yet installed, its deployment should be treated as a prerequisite project.
